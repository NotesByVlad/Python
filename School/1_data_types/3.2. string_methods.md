| str.capitalize()                              | Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased.<br>Changed in version 3.8. The first character is now put into titlecase rather than uppercase.<br>This means that characters like digraphs will only have their first letter capitalized,<br>instead of the full character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| str.casefold()                                | Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for caseless matching.<br>Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all<br>case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to <br>"ss". Since it is already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold() converts it to<br>"ss". The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 ‘Default Case Folding’ <br>of the Unicode Standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| str.center(width[, fillchar])                 | Return centered in a string of length width. Padding is done using the specified fillchar <br>(default is an ASCII space). The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| str.count(sub[, start[, end]])                | Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [start, end]. <br>Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.<br>If sub is empty, returns the number of empty strings between characters which is the length<br>of the string plus one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| str.encode(encoding='utf-8', errors='strict') | Return the string encoded to bytes. Encoding defaults to 'utf-8'; see Standard Encodings <br>for possible values.errors controls how encoding errors are handled. If 'strict' (the default),<br>a UnicodeError exception is raised. Other possible values are 'ignore', 'replace',<br>'xmlcharrefreplace', 'backslashreplace' and any other name registered via codecs.register_error().<br>See Error Handlers for details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])          | Return True if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise return False. suffix can also <br>be a tuple of suffixes to look for. With optional start, test beginning at that position. With <br>optional end, stop comparing at that position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| str.expandtabs(tabsize=8)                     | Return a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced by one or more spaces, depending<br> on the current column and the given tab size. Tab positions occur every tabsize characters <br>(default is 8, giving tab positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on). To expand the string, the <br>current column is set to zero and the string is examined character by character. If the character <br>is a tab (\t), one or more space characters are inserted in the result until the current column is <br>equal to the next tab position. (The tab character itself is not copied.) If the character is a newline<br> (\n) or return (\r), it is copied and the current column is reset to zero. Any other character is <br>copied unchanged and the current column is incremented by one regardless of how the character is <br>represented when printed. |
| str.find(sub[, start[, end]])                 | Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end]. <br>Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found.<br>Note The find() method should be used only if you need to know the position of sub. To check if sub <br>is a substring or not, use the in operator:<br>'Py' in 'Python'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| str.format(*args, **kwargs)                   | Perform a string formatting operation. The string on which this method is called can contain literal<br>text or replacement fields delimited by braces {}. Each replacement field contains either the numeric<br>index of a positional argument, or the name of a keyword argument. Returns a copy of the string where<br>each replacement field is replaced with the string value of the corresponding argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| str.format_map(mapping)                       | Similar to str.format(**mapping), except that mapping is used directly and not copied to a dict. This<br>is useful if for example mapping is a dict subclass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple <br>containing two empty strings, followed by the string itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| str.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)             | Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, at most <br>maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost ones. If sep is not specified or None, any whitespace string is a <br>separator. Except for splitting from the right, rsplit() behaves like split() which is described in detail below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| str.rstrip([chars])                           | Return a copy of the string with trailing characters removed. The chars argument is a string specifying <br>the set of characters to be removed. If omitted or None, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. <br>The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)              | Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, <br>at most maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements). <br>If maxsplit is not specified or -1, then there is no limit on the number of splits <br>(all possible splits are made).<br>If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings<br>(for example, '1,,2'.split(',') returns ['1', '', '2']). The sep argument may consist of multiple characters<br>as a single delimiter (to split with multiple delimiters, use re.split()). Splitting an empty string with a<br>specified separator returns [''].                                                                                                                                                            |
| str.splitlines(keepends=False)                | Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries. Line breaks are not included in the <br>resulting list unless keepends is given and true.<br>This method splits on the following line boundaries. In particular, the boundaries are a superset of <br>universal newlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| str.upper()                                   | Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4] converted to uppercase. <br>Note that s.upper().isupper() might be False if s contains uncased characters or if the Unicode category <br>of the resulting character(s) is not “Lu” (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| str.zfill(width)                              | Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII '0' digits to make a string of length width. A leading sign prefix ('+'/'-') is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character rather than before. The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
