# School Folder - Python Learning Projects

This folder contains a collection of Python programming projects organized by key programming concepts. The projects in this folder are designed to help you learn Python.

## Folder Structure

- **`data_types/`** - Projects focusing on understanding and using Python's built-in data types, such as integers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **`operators/`** - Projects that introduce and explore various operators in Python, including arithmetic, logical, comparison, and assignment operators.
- **`control_flow/`** - Projects focused on control flow structures like `if`, `else`, `elif`, loops (`for`, `while`), and handling conditions in Python.

## Purpose of This Structure

This structure is designed to guide learners through the core concepts of Python:
1. **Data Types**: Learn about Python's built-in data types and how to use them effectively.
2. **Operators**: Understand how to perform calculations and make decisions using Python's operators.
3. **Control Flow**: Master how to control the flow of your program with conditions and loops.

By working through the projects in this folder, you will build a solid understanding of Pythonâ€™s core functionality and be able to apply this knowledge to more complex programming challenges.
